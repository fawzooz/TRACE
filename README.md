# The TRACE Framework for ISO 42001:2023 From Fawzooz.ai

## üéØ Overview

This repository contains the **TRACE Framework**, a comprehensive AI Management System (AIMS) designed to support organizations in implementing ISO/IEC 42001:2023‚Äîthe international standard for Artificial Intelligence Management Systems. The framework was developed as a practical companion to support readers of the book on ISO 42001:2023 implementation.

**Tagline:** Your Blueprint for Verifiable AI Governance.

The TRACE Framework provides a complete set of policies, procedures, templates, and documentation required to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve an AI Management System that ensures responsible AI development and deployment.

## üìö About The TRACE Framework

The TRACE Framework is built on five core pillars, each representing a critical phase in the journey towards ISO 42001 certification and true AI mastery. It is specifically designed for organizations developing and deploying AI systems, with particular attention to high-risk domains such as healthcare and mental wellness.

### The TRACE Pillars

* **R** - **Responsible Governance**: Establishing the organizational structure and policies required for an effective AI Management System (AIMS).
* **A** - **Accountability in Action**: Implementing mechanisms to ensure clear ownership and responsibility for the AI system's decisions and outcomes.
* **C** - **Compliance & Verification**: Systematically validating all activities against the specific clauses and controls of the ISO 42001 standard.
* **E** - **Execution & Evolution**: Deploying the AIMS and committing to the continuous improvement cycle to ensure the system remains effective over time.

### Key Features
* **ISO 42001:2023 Compliant**: Fully aligned with the international standard for AI Management Systems.
